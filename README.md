Machinery is a systems management toolkit for Linux. It supports configuration
discovery, system validation, and service migration. It's based on the idea of a
universal system description.

A spin-off project of Machinery is
[Pennyworth](https://github.com/SUSE/pennyworth), which is used to manage the
integration test environment.

## Installation

Machinery is tested and supported on [openSUSE13.1](http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:13.1)
and SLES 12. It is also supported on [openSUSE13.2](http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:13.2)
but not tested that much yet.
It will not run on other openSUSE versions, Linux distributions, or
operating systems.

The easiest way to install Machinery is as an RPM from our
[homepage](http://machinery-project.org) with
the one-click-installer.

### Development

The following steps are only recommended if you want to work on the Machinery
codebase or test the latest development changes.

  1. **Install Git**

         $ sudo zypper in git

  2. **Install basic Ruby environment**

         $ sudo zypper in ruby rubygem-bundler

     After the installation, make sure that your `ruby20` version is at least
     `2.0.0.p247-3.11.1`:

         $ rpm -q ruby20

     With lower versions, `bundle install` won't work because of a
     [bug](https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=858100).

  3. **Install Machinery's dependencies**

     Install packages needed to compile Gems with native extensions:

         $ sudo zypper in gcc-c++ make ruby-devel libxslt-devel libxml2-devel

  4. **Clone Machinery repository and install Gem dependencies**

         $ git clone git@github.com:SUSE/machinery.git
         $ cd machinery
         $ bundle config build.nokogiri --use-system-libraries
         $ bundle install

  5. **Done!**

     You can now start using Machinery by running `bin/machinery`.

## Usage

Machinery is a command-line tool. You can invoke it using the `bin/machinery`
command. It accepts subcommands (similarly to `git` or `bundle`).

To display a short overview of available commands and their descriptions, use
the `help` command:

    $ machinery help

For more information about the commands, see
[Machinery man page](https://github.com/SUSE/machinery/tree/master/man).
